How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

+ and - signs show the lines that changed, so I could focus on those.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can experiment without worrying about breaking changes. You can always go back to see where was the last working version and see what changed since then.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: More logical portions.
Cons: Might forget.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Different purposes. Google Docs is a general productivity suite, and users are normally working on one file at a time. Git is more of a project management tool, and a project can consist of multiple files.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows you a history of commits with comments (hopefully descriptive). git diff shows you the difference between two commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always rewind.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To take over the world!
