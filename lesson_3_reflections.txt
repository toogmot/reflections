When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborating with others. Using multiple machines. As a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote might be updated with other peoples code that you are not ready for yet.
