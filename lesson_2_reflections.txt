What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates metadata to track files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a place to temporarily hold files while working on them. It allows you to have greater control over what to include in each commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add the files for that change.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Testing new features that you're not sure should be in the main software. Branches allow you to diverge temporarily from the main stream of development.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Err... by diagraming it for you?


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

All changes from both branches are combined. The resulting commit has two parents.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Pros: Saves lots of grunt work. Cons: Not intelligent enough to resolve conflicts.
